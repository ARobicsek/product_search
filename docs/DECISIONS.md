# Decisions Log

ADR-style. One entry per material decision. New entries go at the top. Don't edit accepted decisions in place — add a new entry that supersedes if the call changes.

Status values:
- `PROPOSED` — open. Confirm or override before relying on it.
- `ACCEPTED` — settled. Don't re-debate without proposing a new ADR.
- `SUPERSEDED` — replaced by a later entry; kept for history.

## ADR-016 — Replace Vercel KV with Upstash Redis

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Phase 11 requires key-value storage for web push subscriptions. ADR-010 specified Vercel KV. However, Vercel has deprecated their first-party "Vercel KV" offering in favor of pointing developers directly to Upstash Redis via the Vercel Marketplace.

**Decision**: Provision Upstash Redis through the Vercel Marketplace and use the `@upstash/redis` client instead of `@vercel/kv`. 

**Consequence**: The environment variables injected by Vercel are prefixed with `UPSTASH_REDIS_` instead of `KV_`. The implementation plan for Phase 11 is updated to reflect the package and environment variable changes. The architecture remains functionally identical since Vercel KV was just white-labeled Upstash Redis.

## ADR-015 — Phase 10 onboarding model: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Phase 10 needs an LLM to drive the onboarding interview, with a
strong tool-use loop for `web_search` so the model can suggest Tier B/C
sources for long-tail products (per ADR-013). Two realistic candidates were
on the table:

| Provider:Model | Tool-use quality | Web search wired? | Account ready? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` | first-class, native | hosted server-side via Anthropic's `web_search_20260209` tool — no extra integration | yes (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` already in the slate) |
| `glm:glm-5.1` | unknown for tool-use loops | needs an external search backend (Tavily/Serper) wired up + a function tool | Z.AI wallet is now topped up, but never benchmarked for this call site |

The synthesizer benchmark (ADR-012) does NOT generalise to onboarding
behavior because synthesis is single-shot text formatting; onboarding is
multi-turn with tool use. Picking GLM here would mean debuting an unproven
model on the most tool-use-heavy call site, plus integrating an external
search backend before the feature works once.

**Decision**: Wire `LLM_ONBOARD_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `LLM_ONBOARD_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6`.
Use Anthropic's hosted `web_search_20260209` tool with `max_uses: 5` per turn
to bound cost. The `/api/onboard/chat` route reads the system prompt from the
canonical `worker/src/product_search/onboarding/prompts/onboard_v1.txt` (per
LLM_STRATEGY hard rule #3) and streams text deltas + tool-use signals as SSE
to the browser.

**Consequence**: Each onboarding session uses ~10 turns × ~2K tokens + up to
5 web searches; expected cost is in the cents per onboarding. The web app
gains a new env var (`GITHUB_CONTENTS_TOKEN`, with `contents: write` only)
for the `/api/onboard/save` endpoint that commits the new
`products/<slug>/profile.yaml`. `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` (`actions: write`
only) is reused as a fallback. GLM 5.1 remains a re-benchmark candidate
once we have onboarding fixtures to evaluate against; revisit if Anthropic
costs become a concern or quality drifts.

## ADR-014 — `/api/dispatch` is gated by a browser-exposed secret

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Phase 9 added `POST /api/dispatch`, which the "Run now" button on
`/[product]` calls to trigger an on-demand GitHub Actions run. The phase brief
says "Auth via `WEB_SHARED_SECRET` header." The same `WEB_SHARED_SECRET` is also
intended for Phase 11's `/api/push/notify`, where the worker (with the secret in
GitHub Actions secrets) calls the web app to fan out push notifications.

A browser-side caller can't keep a secret. The two natural choices were:
(a) leave `/api/dispatch` open and rely on same-origin/rate limiting, or
(b) gate it with a "shared" value that the browser also has — which exposes
the same value used by `/api/push/notify` to anyone who views the bundle.

**Decision**: Adopt (b) for now. The web app reads `WEB_SHARED_SECRET`
server-side and the browser sends `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SHARED_SECRET` in the
`x-web-secret` header. In Vercel, both env vars hold the same value for now.
This matches the phase brief and keeps drive-by abuse out without inventing a
second auth scheme.

**Consequence**: When Phase 11 lands `/api/push/notify`, that endpoint MUST
NOT trust the same secret — instead it should rely on a distinct
`PUSH_NOTIFY_SECRET` (server-only, kept in Vercel + GH Actions) so that
exposing the dispatch secret in the browser bundle doesn't let an attacker
forge push notifications. Phase 11 should split the env vars at that time and
update this ADR.

## ADR-013 — LLM-Aided Onboarding & Web Search for Source Discovery

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: The "user enumerates sources in profile" model works well for known domains (e.g., DDR5 RAM) but doesn't generalise to long-tail products (e.g., specific handbags, rare GPUs) where sources aren't known upfront.

**Decision**: Introduce a web-search-capable LLM step *during the Phase 10 Onboarding Interview only*. The LLM will use web search to discover and suggest candidate sources/adapters to the human user. The user reviews these suggestions and, if accepted, creates deterministic adapter stubs.

**Consequence**: We adhere strictly to ADR-011: LLMs are never used for runtime data extraction. We accept the coverage gap for sites that cannot be deterministically scraped. This requires adding a 4th call site to the LLM strategy for "Onboarding source discovery (Web Search)" using a model with strong tool-use capabilities.

## ADR-012 — Phase 5 synthesizer model: GLM 4.5 Flash

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Phase 5 ran the multi-vendor benchmark from [LLM_STRATEGY.md](LLM_STRATEGY.md) across the four configured providers' cheap-tier candidates, plus two Z.AI mid-tier candidates the user wanted to try. Bar: 100% on fabrication and ≥9/10 fixtures pass criteria (2)-(6). Results from `worker/benchmark/results/2026-04-28.md`:

| Provider:Model | Bar | Overall | Fab | Avg cost | p50 latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `glm:glm-4.5-flash` | **PASS** | 10/10 | 10/10 | $0.00000 | 31.84s |
| `anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | fail | 8/10 | 9/10 | $0.00469 | 6.73s |
| `openai:gpt-4o-mini` | fail | 1/10 | 10/10 | $0.00051 | 7.64s |
| `gemini:gemini-2.0-flash` | fail | 0/10 | 0/10 | n/a | (rate-limited) |
| `glm:glm-4.6` | fail | 0/10 | 0/10 | n/a | (no Z.AI balance) |
| `glm:glm-5.1` | fail | 0/10 | 0/10 | n/a | (no Z.AI balance) |

`gpt-4o-mini` was 100% safe on fabrication but inconsistently dropped the "Context" section header — a model behaviour issue, not a check bug (verified by dumping raw output). Haiku 4.5 generated calculated comparisons in commentary that the post-check correctly rejected. Gemini hit 429 on the first call (free-tier exhaustion). Both `glm-4.6` and `glm-5.1` returned "余额不足或无可用资源包" — Z.AI account has free quota only for `glm-4.5-flash`.

**Decision**: Wire `LLM_SYNTH_PROVIDER=glm` and `LLM_SYNTH_MODEL=glm-4.5-flash` as the Phase 5 default. This confirms (rather than refutes) the user's hypothesis recorded in ADR-008 that GLM would win on cost.

**Consequence**: Synthesizer cost is effectively $0 on the free GLM tier. Tradeoff: ~30s p50 latency makes interactive flows feel slow — acceptable for daily scheduled runs but worth re-benchmarking if/when on-demand "Run now" UX needs to feel snappy. Anthropic Haiku 4.5 is a documented fallback for latency-sensitive paths despite its lower fabrication-pass rate (post-check still gates fabricated output).

The benchmark is re-runnable any time via `python -m benchmark.runner`. Re-run when (a) Z.AI balance is topped up so 4.6/5.1 can be evaluated, (b) Gemini billing is set up, (c) the synth prompt changes meaningfully, or (d) GLM 4.5 Flash starts failing on real reports.

## ADR-011 — Adapter authoring philosophy ("deterministic" ≠ "site has an API")

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Question raised: "if the LLM is downstream of the verified data, who assembles the verified data from non-API-able sites?" Worth being explicit since it's a load-bearing distinction.

**Decision**: The LLM is never the extractor. "Deterministic" means the extraction code is written by a human, uses explicit selectors or API calls, and returns `None` when a field is absent rather than guessing. Three tiers of source mechanism, in order of preference:

1. **Real APIs** — eBay Browse API; Shopify storefronts' `/products/<handle>.json` and `/collections/<slug>/products.json` (works for NEMIX, The Server Store, and many others). Trivial adapters.
2. **Server-rendered HTML** — most eBay seller pages, Newegg, ServerSupply, Memory.net. `httpx` + `selectolax`. Adapter author saves an HTML fixture and writes CSS selectors against it.
3. **JS-rendered or anti-bot sites** — Playwright as a last resort, with a per-source rate limit and saved-fixture testing. If a source isn't worth a Playwright adapter, we skip it. Better to have fewer sources than fabricated ones.

Across all tiers: **fixtures are committed**. A test that runs against a fixture verifies the adapter's parsing logic without ever hitting the network. When a site's HTML changes, the test fails loudly — which is the correct failure mode.

**Consequence**: Adapter authoring is real engineering work, not a prompt. Each adapter is ~50-200 lines of focused code. The reward is that the data downstream of an adapter is trustworthy by construction; no LLM gymnastics required to make it safe.

## ADR-010 — iOS-installable PWA with web push for alerts

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user request: "we can use this as a PWA that can alert a user in iOS")

**Context**: User wants iOS push alerts (e.g., price drops, new listings). iOS supports Web Push since iOS 16.4 (March 2023) but **only when the site is installed to the Home Screen as a PWA**.

**Decision**:
- The web app is a PWA from the start: `manifest.webmanifest` with proper icons, `display: standalone`, theme color, and a service worker. Users add to Home Screen on iOS to get the installable experience.
- Web Push uses VAPID-signed messages. Keys (`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`) are environment variables; public is embedded in the client, private stays server-side.
- Push subscription storage: **Vercel KV** (free tier) keyed by a stable client ID. Single-user-shaped today; multi-user-ready if it grows.
- Trigger: the worker, after a scheduled or on-demand run, computes the diff. If material (new entrant, ≥5% price drop, new cheapest), it POSTs to a `/api/push/notify` Vercel route which fans out a Web Push to every stored subscription.
- iOS reality check: notifications only fire for installed PWAs. The UI surfaces a one-time "Add to Home Screen, then enable alerts" affordance for first-time users on iOS Safari.

This becomes Phase 11; see [PHASES.md](PHASES.md). The earlier "polish + second product proof" phase is renumbered to Phase 12.

**Consequence**: Vercel KV is one new piece of state outside the repo. Acceptable given alerts are a real user-facing feature. If we want to stay state-less, an alternative is committing the subscription set to the repo as a JSON file — works for a single user but exposes endpoints in git history; KV is cleaner.

## ADR-009 — Mobile-first web UI

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user request)

**Context**: User wants to launch the system from a phone-friendly web page.

**Decision**: All UI work targets a 375px viewport first. Tables horizontally scroll within their container. "Run now" controls are thumb-reachable. No design system; Tailwind only.

**Consequence**: A phase isn't done until it's been tested at 375px. Desktop layout falls out of mobile-first naturally — no extra design work.

---

## ADR-008 — LLM provider abstraction with vendor benchmark

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user request: "find the least expensive model that does a GOOD job")

**Context**: Four LLM API keys are available (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GLM). Different call sites have different cost sensitivity.

**Decision**: One `call_llm(provider, model, ...)` function behind which all four providers live. Phase 5 builds a benchmark harness that runs the same fixture inputs across configured models and picks the cheapest passing one. Model choice is config (env var), not code.

**Consequence**: Switching models is a secret update, not a deploy. The benchmark itself is a long-lived asset — re-runnable when a new model lands.

---

## ADR-007 — Product profile YAML as the generalization seam

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user request: "set it up so that it could be easily used for ANY product")

**Context**: System started as RAM-specific. User wants it to handle arbitrary products.

**Decision**: Each product is a YAML profile under `products/<slug>/`. Profile declares: target, valid configurations, hard filters, soft flags, sources to query, reference data files, synthesis hints, schedule. The validator pipeline and adapters are written generically; product specifics live in profile data only. `Listing.attrs: dict` carries product-type-specific spec fields whose schema the profile defines.

**Consequence**: Adding a new product type is mostly writing a profile and (sometimes) a new source adapter. Code in `worker/src/product_search/` should never reference RAM specifically.

---

## ADR-006 — On-demand and scheduled runs both in GitHub Actions

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user request: configurable schedule + on-demand)

**Context**: User wants daily/6-hourly/configurable cadence and ability to trigger runs manually from the web.

**Decision**: One scheduled workflow (hourly fan-out reading per-profile crons), one `workflow_dispatch` workflow keyed by product slug. Web UI calls GitHub's REST API to trigger the on-demand workflow.

**Consequence**: No separate scheduling infrastructure. Different products can run on different cadences without one-workflow-per-product proliferation.

---

## ADR-005 — Web app on Vercel, Next.js App Router

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user confirmation)

**Context**: User mentioned Netlify and Vercel as past tools. Wants a simple mobile-friendly UI. User's Vercel projects live at https://vercel.com/aris-projects-b1e40d05 — this project will be created there.

**Decision**: Vercel + Next.js App Router. Tailwind for styling. Server-rendered routes for read paths; small API routes for `dispatch`, `onboard`, and `push/notify`.

**Consequence**: Stack is mainstream and well-supported by AI co-pilots. The Phase 8 dev session creates a new Vercel project under the user's team and links it to this repo for preview deploys per branch.

---

## ADR-004 — Worker hosted on GitHub Actions only (no separate worker service)

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user confirmation)

**Context**: Worker needs to run on a schedule and on demand. Avoids always-on cost.

**Decision (proposed)**: GitHub Actions only. Repository is the database (committed reports). SQLite lives only inside the workflow run for diff-vs-yesterday computation.

**Consequence**: Free for public repos. No infra to manage. Tradeoff: a stand-alone worker service would let us keep a longer-lived SQLite. The plan accepts this tradeoff because reports + diff are sufficient state.

---

## ADR-003 — eBay Browse API (not HTML scraping) for the eBay adapter

**Status**: ACCEPTED (per user confirmation)

**Context**: eBay is a Tier A source. Two ways in: official Browse API or HTML scraping.

**Decision (proposed)**: Official API. Free tier ~5000 calls/day is plenty. More stable than scraping.

**Consequence**: One-time eBay developer registration. Two extra secrets in CI (`EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`). Simpler adapter code.

---

## ADR-002 — Repo-as-database; SQLite as workflow-local cache only

**Status**: ACCEPTED

**Context**: Need to persist daily reports and (for diff) yesterday's listings. Don't want to host a database.

**Decision**: Reports are markdown files committed to `reports/<slug>/<date>.md`. Listings persist via SQLite that lives inside each workflow run, populated from the previous run's CSV (also committed to a `data/` branch or to the same workflow's cache).

**Consequence**: No database hosting cost. Slight awkwardness around "yesterday's listings" — solved by either (a) committing daily CSVs to the repo or (b) using GitHub Actions cache. Plan favors (a) for auditability and (b) as fallback if commits get noisy.

---

## ADR-001 — LLM is downstream of verified data only

**Status**: ACCEPTED (architectural commitment from the handoff)

**Context**: Conversational LLMs reliably fabricate prices and stock when asked to find listings. Stricter prompts don't fix this.

**Decision**: The LLM has no web access in this system. Inputs are JSON the deterministic layer produced. Outputs are formatted markdown. Synthesizer post-check rejects any number/URL/MPN in the report that doesn't appear in the input.

**Consequence**: Cheaper models can be used (the LLM has an easy job). Failure mode "LLM made up a price" is structurally impossible. The cost is some flexibility — if a synthesizer wants to caveat a listing with information not in the input, it can't.
